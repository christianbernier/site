# site
My personal website to show some of my recent programming projects.

## Development

I created this site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a node script (`build.js`) that takes an HTML template and list of projects (in JSON) and creates a modified HTML file with the portfolio populated.

## Build

To build the site, run

```
npm run build
```

This takes files from the `src` folder and exports the built site to the `public` folder.
